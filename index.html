			<h2>Childhood Memories</h2>
            <hr>
			<p>One of my favorite childhood experiences was when I received my
                first computer at the age of 14. I was fascinated by the technology 
                and spent countless hours exploring and learning about different software.
                This experience sparked my interest in technology and eventually led me to pursue a degree in information technology.
                As I continued my studies, I became particularly interested in cybersecurity and data protection, 
                which eventually became my specialization. 
                This childhood experience has played a significant role in shaping my passion and career path in the field of technology and security.</p>
